# About

This a little project I used to test gpt-engineer https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer

We are writing a page about how to fix smartphone speakes that were exposed to humidity or water, but playing a mp3 file capable of cleaning smartphone speakers. The page must use javascript, vue, vuetify and have i18n support for portugues, english, chinese, hindi, japanese, running on a vite server. The language must change via url and flag icons on the appbar, the name of the application is Fix Speaker and it should be translated as well. MVC components split in separate files. Main public are mobile users so responsiveness is a must. There should be only one button and taping/clicking on the button should start playing, stop playing, if tapped again it must start from the beginning, the button must be green when not playing and red while playing, also should be round and large with a shadow effect. This is the explanation tha needs to be shown to the user: How it works 🛠
So you've dropped your phone in the 🚽 toilet, 🚰 sink or 🏊‍ pool? When water gets into your phone's speaker enclosure the sound becomes muffled. Leaving any type of fluid in your speaker can cause serious damage when it dries out. It works just like the ⌚️ Apple watch's built-in water ejection feature. It plays a specific tone that generates sound waves which causes the water to be ejected.
