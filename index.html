  <meta name="description" content="So you\'ve dropped your phone in the 🚽 toilet, 🚰 sink or 🏊‍ pool? When water gets into your phone\'s speaker enclosure the sound becomes muffled. Leaving any type of fluid in your speaker can cause serious damage when it dries out. It works just like the ⌚️ Apple watch\'s built-in water ejection feature. It plays a specific tone that generates sound waves which causes the water to be ejected."/>
